TO DO:
1) DONE: Create repo & clone to device
2) Setup each page's basic html
   * Make sure to link bootstrap
   * Reference another style sheet, which I'll have to create 
3) Refine HTML
   * Nav Bar is going to be on each. Get this right, then copy/paste
4) Refine CSS sheet


HELP I NEED:
1) Is an image better to be in the CSS or in the HTML itself? We saw it in the CSS in the last HW. Ask about my img tag & alt text in the last HW.
ANSWER for #1: Background images have to be in CSS. 
GOOGLE how to add a background image CSS

2) Readme from HW 1
ANSWER: MD files are MarkDown files. Which means that I can do some things to pretty it up in a preview.

Example: # is H1, ## is H2, etc. The numbered list I did worked, but the (a,b,cs) I did
* is italics
**Is bold**

Add a link in the deployed site should have been reademe as well. LOOK UP HOW TO LINK TO A WWW.

Screenshots might be a good idea.

# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* DONE: Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar (SERIF FONT for the nave bar header & the header within the main page. Sans Serif for all other text it looks like.)

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

*   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

* Notes from Jonathan on styling & other comments:
SERIF FONT for the nave bar header & the header within the main page. Sans Serif for all other text it looks like.
The submit button has 90 degree corners. It is not rounded.
Use a color picker to grab the right kind of teal.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project


### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!


## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URLs of the deployed applications

* The URLs of the GitHub repositories
